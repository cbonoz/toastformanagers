## What does this Alexa app do? 
* Restaurants can set up their Toast for Managers account by registering their Toast API key with their alexa.
* Manager accounts can ask Alexa about their sales and recent business performance by issuing Alexa a list of 
predefined commands.

## Ok, so how do I interact with Toast For Managers?

*  "Alexa, ask Toast for Managers for my sales for today.
*  "Alexa, ask Toast for Managers for my sales on July 15th, 2017. 
*  "Alexa, ask Toast for Managers to compare my sales today to my sales yesterday. 

<b><i>Alexa will respond to these requests with responses like these:</i></b>

*  "For today were $2,467.65. (Say another command, or say help for a list of example questions)
<!-- TODO: Add more example responses -->

## Future Work:

* Ability to drill down further (verbally) into metrics and details.
